# Pocket Diary React Native

My second React Native project, aiming to create a fully functional diary app where users can rely on taking notes, tracking grades, and managing to-do lists.

## Current State
The application is still under development, but it already features authentication using Firebase and a database powered by Firestore.

## Features (in progress)
- User authentication with Firebase
- Data storage using Firestore
- Note-taking functionality
- Grade tracking
- To-do list management

## Roadmap
The app is still being actively developed, and I'm working on adding more features and functionality. Stay tuned for updates!
